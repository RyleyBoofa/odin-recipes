# Odin Recipes

A simple recipe website, built as my solution to The Odin Project's [Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). The website consists of a main index page that links to several recipes. This first section focuses on HTML and will be enhanced with CSS later.

## Skills used

- HTML: boilerplate, text formatting, lists, links, and images 
- Git: basic version control

## References
