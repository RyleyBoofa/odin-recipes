        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Serving size: 4</p>
        <p>Sausage patties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>500g ground pork (optionally swap for ground beef)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sage, dried, ground</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp thyme, dried</li>
            <li>1 tsp onion powder (optionally swap for garlic powder)</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Muffins:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>4 English muffins</li>
            <li>4 slices cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 130&deg;C.</li>
            <li>Place muffins on a baking trey, cut side up.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Sausage patties:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix sausage patty ingredients in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Shape into 4 patties. Make them slightly larger than the muffins because they will shrink when cooking.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over high heat. Add patties and cook first side for 2-3 minutes, until brown. 
                Flip them and cook the other side until brown. <strong>Don't forget to top them with cheese after flipping!</strong>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Eggs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat another pan over medium-high heat with 1 tbsp oil.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into the pan (use egg-rings if you have them). 
                Add about 2 tbsp water into the skillet then cover with a lid. 
                Cook for 1-2 minutes or until eggs are cooked to your liking.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Assemble the muffins in this order (bottom-to-top):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Muffin bottom</li>            
            <li>Sausage patty, topped with cheese</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Muffin top (optionally add some sauce, if desired)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now all that's left to do is enjoy your homemade McDonald's!</p>
