                <h2 class="section-title">Steps</h2>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>Preheat oven to 130&deg;C.</li>
                    <li>Place muffins on a baking tray, cut side up.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="ingredients">Sausage patties:</p>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>Mix sausage patty ingredients in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>
                        Shape into 4 patties. Make them slightly larger than the muffins because
                        they will shrink when cooking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over high heat. Add patties and cook
                        first side for 2-3 minutes, until brown. Flip them and cook the other side
                        until brown.
                        <span>Don't forget to top them with cheese after flipping!</span>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="ingredients">Eggs:</p>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>Meanwhile, heat another pan over medium-high heat with 1 tbsp oil.</li>
                    <li>
                        Crack the eggs into the pan (use egg-rings if you have them). Add about 2
                        tbsp water into the skillet then cover with a lid. Cook for 1-2 minutes or
                        until eggs are cooked to your liking.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="ingredients">Assemble the muffins in this order (bottom-to-top):</p>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>Muffin bottom</li>
                    <li>Sausage patty, topped with cheese</li>
                    <li>Egg</li>
                    <li>Muffin top (optionally add some sauce, if desired)</li>
